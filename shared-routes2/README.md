# Shared Routing Example

This example demos two applications with their own sets of routes and deployments but a seamless experience for the user.

- `app1` contains the "Home Page" (/) route.
- `app2` contains the "About Page" (/about) route.
- `app1` also exposes `Navigation` component.

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `app1` and `app2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/)
