# Basic One-Way Example

This example demos a basic host application loading remote component.

- `website1` is the host application.
- `website2` standalone application which exposes `Header` component.

# Running Demo

Run `yarn start`. This will build and serve both `website1` and `website2` on ports 3001 and 3002 respectively.

- [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001/) (HOST)
- [localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002/) (STANDALONE REMOTE)
